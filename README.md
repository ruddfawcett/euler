A collection of [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net) solutions.

My goal is to try to solve the problems as simply as possible computationally: using basic logic, branching, and looping.  Some of the solutions may be rather verbose and might not take the best approach.

Also, while code golf is fun, it can often obfuscate code, making it hard to understand. It would be a good exercise to try to solve these problems as concisely as possible, though that is *not* the goal of this repository.
